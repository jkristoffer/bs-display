# CSS Cleanup Requirements Brief
# Generated: 2025-07-23

project:
  name: "CSS Architecture Cleanup"
  description: "Systematic cleanup of CSS architecture to create a single source of truth while maintaining exact visual parity"
  
goals:
  primary: "Create a cleaner, more maintainable CSS codebase that AI agents can easily understand and extend"
  secondary:
    - "Establish single source of truth for all styles"
    - "Reduce CSS bundle size and improve performance"
    - "Prevent future style proliferation"
    - "Enable consistent development patterns"

constraints:
  visual_changes: "ZERO - Website must look exactly the same after cleanup"
  testing_approach: "Manual verification with clear documentation of affected pages"
  team_size: "Single developer"
  rollout_strategy: "Phased approach with progress tracking"

current_issues:
  variable_proliferation:
    - "300+ CSS variables with 60-70% unused"
    - "3-5x redundancy across color, typography, and spacing systems"
    - "Conflicting definitions and legacy variables"
  
  component_problems:
    - "50+ inline styles in FilterUIv2.tsx"
    - "Hardcoded values throughout components (#666, 10px, etc.)"
    - "Mixed styling approaches (CSS modules, global styles, inline)"
    - "79KB quiz-styles.scss causing global pollution"
  
  performance_impact:
    - "~40KB unused CSS (33% of total)"
    - "~25KB from duplicate systems"
    - "PurgeCSS misconfigured"
    - "No CSS minification"
  
  developer_experience:
    - "AI agents don't follow existing patterns"
    - "No clear guidelines on which variables to use"
    - "Multiple conflicting systems confuse developers"
    - "No enforcement mechanisms"

success_criteria:
  technical:
    - "Single, unified design token system"
    - "100% CSS module adoption for components"
    - "Zero hardcoded values in styles"
    - "Automated linting and validation"
    - "Clear documentation for AI agents"
  
  measurable:
    - "CSS bundle size reduced by 50%+"
    - "Variable count reduced by 70%"
    - "CSS quality score > 85"
    - "Zero visual regressions"
  
  process:
    - "Comprehensive style guide created"
    - "AI-friendly documentation and examples"
    - "Tooling prevents future regression"
    - "Clear migration patterns established"

deliverables:
  documentation:
    - "Style guide with clear variable usage"
    - "AI agent instructions in CLAUDE.md"
    - "Migration guide for developers"
    - "Visual testing checklist"
  
  tooling:
    - "CSS linting configuration"
    - "Variable usage analyzer"
    - "Build process optimizations"
    - "Pre-commit hooks"
  
  code_changes:
    - "Consolidated variable system"
    - "Refactored components"
    - "Cleaned build configuration"
    - "Removed unused code"

implementation_preferences:
  approach: "Conservative - prioritize safety over speed"
  communication: "Document all changes and affected pages"
  tooling: "Extend existing tools, add new ones as needed"
  context_building: "Maximum documentation for future AI agents"

phases:
  phase_1:
    name: "Foundation & Quick Wins"
    duration: "1 week"
    focus: "Tooling setup, documentation, and immediate optimizations"
    
  phase_2:
    name: "Variable Consolidation"
    duration: "1 week"
    focus: "Create unified design token system"
    
  phase_3:
    name: "Component Migration"
    duration: "2 weeks"
    focus: "Systematically update all components"
    
  phase_4:
    name: "Validation & Documentation"
    duration: "1 week"
    focus: "Testing, documentation, and knowledge transfer"

risk_mitigation:
  visual_regression:
    - "Component-by-component approach"
    - "Detailed before/after documentation"
    - "Rollback procedures for each change"
  
  ai_adoption:
    - "Clear examples in codebase"
    - "Comprehensive CLAUDE.md updates"
    - "Linting rules enforce patterns"
