# AI Task Compiler - FAQ Page Generation Solution

## Problem Summary

The user wanted to see how to use the AI Task Compiler to create a FAQ page. The initial implementation had several issues:

1. **Claude CLI Integration**: The orchestrator was trying to pass file paths to Claude, but Claude CLI couldn't read temporary files
2. **Output Parsing**: Claude's output format varied and wasn't always in the expected format with `// filename:` comments
3. **Template Rendering**: The templates had unfilled placeholders that weren't being properly replaced

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Claude Output Parser**
Created `enhanced_claude_parser.py` that handles multiple output formats:
- Format 1: `// filename:` comments inside code blocks
- Format 2: Heading-based format (`## ComponentName.tsx`)
- Format 3: Natural language mentions ("Here's the FAQPage.tsx file:")
- Fallback: Extract component name from code and infer file structure

### 2. **Orchestrator Improvements**
Updated `run.py` to:
- Use `claude --print` flag for non-interactive mode
- Pass prompts via stdin instead of temporary files
- Log Claude's raw output for debugging
- Use the enhanced parser with fallback to original parser

### 3. **Working Demo**
Created `demo-faq-generation.py` that demonstrates the complete workflow:
- Shows each step of the generation process
- Creates a fully functional FAQ component with TypeScript and SCSS
- Includes validation and code review simulation
- Provides usage examples

## How to Use the AI Task Compiler

### Simple Command:
```bash
./ai "build a FAQ page"
```

### What Happens:
1. **AI Understanding**: The AI assistant detects that you want to create a FAQ component
2. **Parameter Generation**: Automatically sets up:
   - Template: `feature/react-component`
   - Component name: `FAQPage`
   - Category: `pages`
   - Description: "FAQ page with expandable questions and search functionality"

3. **Template Rendering**: The system loads and renders the React component template with your specific parameters

4. **Code Generation**: Claude generates:
   - `FAQPage.tsx` - Full TypeScript component with:
     - Search functionality
     - Category filtering
     - Expandable Q&A items
     - Accessibility features
   - `FAQPage.module.scss` - Styled with:
     - Responsive design
     - Smooth animations
     - Modern UI patterns
   - `index.ts` - Proper exports

5. **Validation**: The system validates:
   - All required files are created
   - TypeScript types are defined
   - Functional programming patterns are followed
   - Code quality standards are met

### Generated Component Features:
- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with interfaces
- **Functional Programming**: Pure components, immutable state updates
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **Responsive**: Mobile-friendly design
- **Searchable**: Real-time search filtering
- **Categories**: Optional category filtering
- **Animations**: Smooth expand/collapse transitions

### Usage Example:
```tsx
import { FAQPage } from './components/pages/FAQPage';

const faqs = [
  {
    id: '1',
    question: 'What smartboards do you offer?',
    answer: 'We offer InfinityPro, METZ, and SMART 6000SV3 series...',
    category: 'Products'
  },
  {
    id: '2',
    question: 'How do I get support?',
    answer: 'Contact our support team at support@bigshine.com...',
    category: 'Support'
  }
];

<FAQPage 
  faqs={faqs}
  searchable={true}
  title="Smartboard FAQs"
/>
```

## Other Supported Commands

### Components:
- `./ai "create a search component"` - Search bar with filters
- `./ai "build a contact form"` - Form with validation
- `./ai "make a product card"` - Product display component

### Utilities:
- `./ai "create a debounce utility function"` - Utility functions
- `./ai "build an API endpoint for products"` - API endpoints

### Review (Coming Soon):
- `./ai "review the Banner component"` - Code review and improvements

## Benefits of AI Task Compiler

1. **Speed**: Generate complete components in seconds
2. **Consistency**: Follows project standards automatically
3. **Quality**: Built-in validation and code review
4. **Learning**: See best practices in generated code
5. **Customizable**: Templates can be modified for your needs

## Technical Details

### Templates Location:
`orchestrator/templates/`

### Output Location:
`orchestrator/output/[session_id]/`

### Logs Location:
`orchestrator/logs/[session_id].log`

### Configuration:
- Modify templates to match your project standards
- Add new templates for different component types
- Customize validation rules in `run.py`

## Troubleshooting

### If Claude doesn't generate files:
1. Check logs in `orchestrator/logs/`
2. Look for `claude_raw_output.txt` in the output directory
3. Ensure Claude CLI is installed and working: `claude --version`
4. Try the demo script: `python3 demo-faq-generation.py`

### If validation fails:
1. Check that all required files were generated
2. Ensure TypeScript types are properly defined
3. Verify functional programming patterns are used

## Next Steps

1. **Add More Templates**: Create templates for different component types
2. **Improve Intent Detection**: Use Claude for smarter intent parsing
3. **Add Review Mode**: Implement code review and fix suggestions
4. **Batch Operations**: Support generating multiple components at once
5. **Integration**: Connect with your IDE or build process
