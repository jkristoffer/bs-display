## For AI Assistants

AI assistants working on this project should:

1. **Follow CLAUDE.md**: Primary guidance document with architecture, patterns, and AI development workflows
2. **Reference Standards**: Use `/src/development-standards/standards/` for specific implementation patterns (components, styling, file naming, data management)
3. **AI-First Development**: This project uses human-AI pair programming with rapid development cycles (30min-6hr features)

**Documentation Hierarchy:**
1. **PRIMARY**: `CLAUDE.md` - Complete AI guidance including development patterns and requirements
2. **SECONDARY**: `/src/development-standards/standards/` - Detailed implementation standards
