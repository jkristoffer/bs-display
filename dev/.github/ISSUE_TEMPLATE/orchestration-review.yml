        ## üîç AI Task Compiler Orchestration Review
        
        The AI Task Compiler orchestration system has evolved significantly and now requires a comprehensive review to ensure optimal performance, maintainability, and scalability. The system has transitioned from basic component generation to a full AI-first development pipeline with git worktree isolation.
        
        **Current State**: The system works functionally but needs expert review for production readiness, performance optimization, and architectural improvements.
        
        **Goal**: Conduct a thorough analysis and provide recommendations for system improvements, optimizations, and potential refactoring.

      value: |
        ## Current System Architecture
        
        ### Core Components
        1. **Main Entry Points**:
           - `./ai` - Unified AI-first interface (delegates to worktree orchestrator)
           - `./ai-pro` - Redirect to `./ai` (backward compatibility)
           - `./ai-legacy` - Backup of original implementation
        
        2. **Orchestration Engine**:
           - `orchestrator/ai-worktree-orchestrator.py` - Main orchestration pipeline
           - `orchestrator/ai-working.py` - Template-based component generation
           - `orchestrator/ai-orchestrated.py` - Legacy full pipeline (fallback)
        
        3. **Supporting Infrastructure**:
           - `orchestrator/cleanup.py` - System cleanup and maintenance
           - `orchestrator/enhanced_claude_parser.py` - Output parsing utilities
           - `orchestrator/claude_output_parser.py` - Legacy parser
        
        ### Pipeline Flow
        ```
        User Input ‚Üí ./ai ‚Üí ai-worktree-orchestrator.py ‚Üí 6-Step Pipeline:
        1. Create Isolated Worktree
        2. Generate Component (via ai-working.py)
        3. Validate Standards
        4. Run Tests
        5. Integrate Files
        6. Create Commit
        ```
        
        ### Component Templates
        The system includes pre-built, high-quality templates for:
        - **FAQPage**: Accordion-style FAQ with search functionality
        - **ContactForm**: Full form validation and error handling
        - **SearchBar**: Debounced search with clear functionality
        - **Button**: Multi-variant button with accessibility features

        ## Known Issues and Pain Points
        
        ### Identified Areas for Improvement
        
        1. **Template System Scalability**:
           - Templates are hardcoded in Python dictionaries
           - Adding new component types requires code changes
           - No external template file system
           - Limited customization options
        
        2. **Error Handling Gaps**:
           - Limited handling of git operation failures
           - Incomplete recovery from partial worktree states
           - Insufficient validation of system prerequisites
           - No rollback mechanism for failed operations
        
        3. **Configuration Management**:
           - No centralized configuration system
           - Hardcoded paths and settings
           - Limited user customization options
           - No environment-specific configurations
        
        4. **Testing and Validation**:
           - Simulated test results (not actual test execution)
           - Limited integration with existing test frameworks
           - No automated quality gate enforcement
           - Missing edge case coverage
        
        5. **Documentation and Discoverability**:
           - Complex file structure with multiple entry points
           - Limited inline documentation
           - No centralized command reference
           - Unclear troubleshooting guidance
        
        6. **Performance Optimization Opportunities**:
           - Redundant file operations
           - Inefficient worktree cleanup algorithms
           - No caching mechanisms for repeated operations
           - Suboptimal concurrent operation handling

        ## Important Context for the Reviewer
        
        1. **System Purpose**:
           This is an AI-first development tool designed to generate high-quality React components with complete isolation using git worktrees. It's part of a larger Astro-based e-commerce platform for interactive displays.
        
        2. **Target Users**:
           - Developers working on component libraries
           - Teams requiring rapid, high-quality component generation
           - Projects needing isolated development environments
           - AI-assisted development workflows
        
        3. **Quality Standards**:
           The system enforces strict functional programming patterns, TypeScript compliance, accessibility standards, and professional git workflows. Quality is prioritized over speed.
        
        4. **Evolution History**:
           The system evolved from basic template generation to full orchestration with worktree isolation. Recent changes merged ai/ai-pro into a unified AI-first interface.
        
        5. **Current Status**:
           The system is functional and generates high-quality components reliably, but lacks comprehensive testing, configuration management, and scalability considerations for production use.
        
        ## Review Approach Suggestions
        
        1. **Start with Architecture**: Understand the overall flow from user input to final commit
        2. **Focus on Core Components**: Priority on ai-worktree-orchestrator.py and ai-working.py
        3. **Evaluate User Experience**: Command-line interface and output quality
        4. **Assess Maintainability**: Code organization, documentation, and extensibility
        5. **Consider Scalability**: Future growth and enterprise requirements
        
        ## Key Questions to Address
        
        1. Is the current architecture sustainable for long-term development?
        2. Are there significant performance bottlenecks that need immediate attention?
        3. What are the highest-impact improvements that could be implemented quickly?
        4. How well does the system handle edge cases and error scenarios?
        5. What would it take to make this production-ready for a larger development team?
