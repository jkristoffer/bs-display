## Metrics Collection System

### 1. Automated Metrics
```javascript
// Metrics collection configuration
const metricsConfig = {
  collectors: {
    git: {
      enabled: true,
      metrics: ["files_changed", "commits", "lines_modified"]
    },
    performance: {
      enabled: true,
      tool: "lighthouse",
      metrics: ["lcp", "fid", "cls", "ttfb"]
    },
    visual: {
      enabled: true,
      tool: "percy",
      metrics: ["visual_diffs", "approved_changes"]
    },
    bundle: {
      enabled: true,
      metrics: ["size_delta", "chunk_count", "css_size"]
    }
  },
  
  reporting: {
    frequency: "daily",
    storage: "metrics_database",
    alerts: true
  }
}
```

### 2. Manual Tracking
```markdown
## Weekly Progress Report Template

### Week of: [DATE]

#### Completed This Week
- [ ] Component migrations: X/Y
- [ ] Visual regression fixes: X
- [ ] Performance optimizations: X
- [ ] Documentation updates: X pages

#### Blockers & Issues
- Issue 1: [Description] - [Status]
- Issue 2: [Description] - [Status]

#### Next Week Goals
- [ ] Complete Phase X
- [ ] Migrate Y components
- [ ] Address Z blockers
```

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Migration Velocity
```yaml
velocity_metrics:
  target: "2 components per day"
  calculation: "completed_components / days_elapsed"
  thresholds:
    excellent: "> 3 components/day"
    good: "2-3 components/day"
    concerning: "1-2 components/day"
    critical: "< 1 component/day"
```

### Quality Metrics
```yaml
quality_kpis:
  visual_consistency:
    target: 95%
    measurement: "components_matching_style_guide / total_components"
    
  performance_impact:
    target: "< 5% regression"
    measurement: "current_metrics / baseline_metrics"
    
  accessibility_compliance:
    target: 100%
    measurement: "components_without_violations / total_components"
    
  developer_satisfaction:
    target: "> 4.0/5.0"
    measurement: "survey_results"
```

## Progress Tracking Formulas

### Overall Progress
```python
# Overall migration progress calculation
def calculate_overall_progress():
    phases = [
        {"weight": 0.10, "progress": phase_1_progress},
        {"weight": 0.15, "progress": phase_2_progress},
        {"weight": 0.15, "progress": phase_3_progress},
        {"weight": 0.30, "progress": phase_4_progress},
        {"weight": 0.15, "progress": phase_5_progress},
        {"weight": 0.10, "progress": phase_6_progress},
        {"weight": 0.05, "progress": phase_7_progress}
    ]
    
    total = sum(phase["weight"] * phase["progress"] for phase in phases)
    return round(total, 2)
```

### Component Coverage
```python
# Component migration coverage
def calculate_component_coverage():
    total_components = 30  # Estimated
    migrated_components = count_migrated_components()
    
    coverage = (migrated_components / total_components) * 100
    return {
        "percentage": coverage,
        "migrated": migrated_components,
        "remaining": total_components - migrated_components
    }
```
