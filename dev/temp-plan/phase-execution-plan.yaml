technical_specifications:
  - "Follow functional programming principles throughout the analysis"
  - "Use existing TypeScript interfaces where possible, extend only when necessary"
  - "Maintain compatibility with current Astro 5.x and React 19 architecture"
  - "Ensure all recommendations align with existing SCSS design system"
  - "Document all file paths and component relationships for future reference"
  - "Identify opportunities for code reuse without introducing technical debt"

quality_gates:
  - "All existing product data fields are cataloged and typed"
  - "Filtering system analysis covers all current filtering capabilities"
  - "Component reuse plan doesn't break existing functionality"
  - "Architecture design supports all requirements from requirements-brief.yaml"
  - "TypeScript interfaces are compatible with existing data structures"
  - "No new dependencies introduced without justification"

risk_mitigation:
  - "Data structure changes: Document all assumptions and validate with existing data files"
  - "Component compatibility: Test reusable components in isolation before integration"
