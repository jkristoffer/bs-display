# Archived BI Documentation

**Status**: ARCHIVED (January 11, 2025)  
**Reason**: Custom analytics implementation disabled due to Vercel Hobby plan limitations  

---

## Archive Contents

This directory contains documentation for analytics implementations that were planned but not deployed due to architectural constraints on the Vercel Hobby plan.

### Custom Analytics Implementation
- **ultra-low-cost-analytics-deployment.md**: Detailed deployment guide for custom analytics
- **ultra-low-cost-analytics-summary.md**: Cost analysis and implementation summary
- **vercel-kv-edge-config-setup.md**: Storage setup guide for custom analytics
- **QUICK_SETUP.md**: Quick setup guide for custom analytics
- **data-integration-plan.md**: Comprehensive data integration strategy

### Dashboard Enhancement
- **dashboard-integration-plan.md**: Enhanced dashboard features for custom analytics

## Why Archived?

These documents represent significant planning and design work for a custom analytics system. However, the implementation was disabled due to:

1. **Vercel Hobby Plan Limitations**: Cron jobs limited to daily frequency (needs 5-minute intervals)
2. **Cost Unpredictability**: Risk of exceeding free tier limits
3. **Over-Engineering**: Complex architecture not suited for Hobby plan constraints

## Current Implementation

**Active Solution**: Google Analytics 4 (GA4)
- **Status**: âœ… Fully operational
- **Documentation**: See parent directory
- **Benefits**: Industry standard, zero maintenance, reliable data

## Future Consideration

These archived documents will be valuable if the project upgrades to **Vercel Pro plan** ($20/month), which would enable:
- Custom cron job frequencies
- Higher function execution limits
- Cost-predictable scaling

**Review Trigger**: Vercel Pro plan upgrade or business requirement change  
**Estimated Re-implementation Time**: 2-4 hours (Redis client setup) + testing
