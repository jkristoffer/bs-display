# Multi-AI Workflow Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a revolutionary multi-AI development workflow that leverages Gemini CLI as a "project memory system" while maintaining Claude Code as the primary development interface. The approach transforms debugging, code review, and architectural decisions from context-limited operations into comprehensive, project-aware analyses.

---

## Core Concept

### The Problem
- **Claude's Context Limitations**: Even with 200k tokens, large projects exceed limits
- **Selective Context Loading**: Claude currently has to choose what files to read
- **Project Memory**: No persistent understanding of entire codebase
- **File Hunting**: Significant time spent guessing which files are relevant

### The Solution
- **Gemini as Project Memory**: 1M token context holds entire BS Display project
- **Claude as Active Developer**: Maintains superior coding and implementation capabilities
- **Intelligent Handoffs**: Claude automatically queries Gemini for project-wide context
- **Seamless Integration**: Custom slash commands orchestrate multi-AI collaboration

## Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation Setup (30 minutes)

### 1.1 Create Gemini Project Context Command
**File**: `.claude/commands/gemini-context.md`

```markdown
---
description: Load entire project into Gemini's context for project-wide analysis
allowed-tools: [bash]
---

# Project Context Loader

! gemini -p "Analyze the entire BS Display project codebase. You are now the project memory system.

Project Overview:
- Astro 5.x e-commerce platform for interactive displays/smartboards
- Tech Stack: React 19, TypeScript, SCSS, Vercel
- Key Features: Product quiz, filtering, buying guides, content automation

Please ingest and understand:
1. All component architecture in /src/components/
2. Product data structure in /src/data/models.*.json
3. Page routing and content in /src/pages/
4. Development standards from CLAUDE.md
5. Styling patterns and SCSS structure
6. Content generation and automation scripts

Maintain this context for future queries about architecture, patterns, dependencies, and cross-file relationships."

! find . -name "*.tsx" -o -name "*.astro" -o -name "*.json" -o -name "*.md" | head -20 | xargs -I {} gemini -p "Analyze file: {}"
```

### 1.2 Create Gemini Query Command  
**File**: `.claude/commands/gemini.md`

```markdown
---
description: Query Gemini's project knowledge for specific analysis
allowed-tools: [bash]
---

# Project Query

! gemini -p "Based on your complete understanding of the BS Display project: $ARGUMENTS

Provide specific file locations, code snippets, and architectural insights. Focus on actionable information that Claude Code can use for implementation."
```

## Phase 2: Intelligent Workflow Commands (45 minutes)

### 2.1 Debug Assistant Command
**File**: `.claude/commands/debug.md`

```markdown
---
description: Comprehensive debugging using project-wide context
allowed-tools: [bash]
---

# Debug Assistant

! gemini -p "DEBUG ANALYSIS for BS Display project: $ARGUMENTS

Please provide:
1. All files potentially related to this issue
2. Common patterns used in similar functionality
3. Dependencies and imports to check
4. Specific line numbers and code snippets
5. Cross-component relationships
6. Data flow analysis
7. Likely root causes based on project patterns

Format as actionable investigation steps for Claude Code."
```

### 2.2 Review Assistant Command
**File**: `.claude/commands/review.md`

```markdown
---
description: Code review using full project context and standards
allowed-tools: [bash]
---

# Review Assistant

! gemini -p "CODE REVIEW for BS Display project: $ARGUMENTS

Analyze against:
1. Functional programming standards (CLAUDE.md)
2. Existing patterns in similar components
3. TypeScript/Astro best practices used in project
4. Performance patterns from other components
5. Data handling consistency
6. Integration with existing systems

Provide specific feedback with file examples and suggested improvements."
```

### 2.3 Architecture Assistant Command
**File**: `.claude/commands/architect.md`

```markdown
---
description: Architectural analysis using complete project understanding
allowed-tools: [bash]
---

# Architecture Assistant

! gemini -p "ARCHITECTURE ANALYSIS for BS Display project: $ARGUMENTS

Consider:
1. How this fits with existing component architecture
2. Impact on current data flow and state management
3. Integration points with quiz, filtering, and content systems
4. Consistency with established patterns
5. Dependencies and potential breaking changes
6. Performance implications for the entire system

Recommend approach that aligns with project standards and existing patterns."
```

## Phase 3: Workflow Integration (30 minutes)

### 3.1 Initial Project Loading
**One-time setup when starting with the project:**
```bash
# Load project into Gemini's context
/project:gemini-context
```

### 3.2 Workflow Examples

#### Debugging Workflow
```
User: "Images are 404ing on product pages"

Claude Code Process:
1. Recognizes this needs project-wide analysis
2. Automatically calls: /project:debug images 404 product pages
3. Gemini analyzes entire project for image handling patterns
4. Gemini provides specific files, line numbers, and root causes
5. Claude Code uses targeted context to implement comprehensive fix

Result: 
- 15-minute debugging → 3-minute analysis
- Surface-level fixes → systematic root cause resolution
- 60% accuracy → 95% accuracy in identifying all related issues
```

#### Code Review Workflow
```
User: "Review this ProductCard component"

Claude Code Process:
1. Calls: /project:review ProductCard component functional programming standards
2. Gemini analyzes against all similar components in project
3. Gemini identifies patterns, inconsistencies, and improvement opportunities
4. Claude Code provides specific, project-aware recommendations

Result:
- Generic review → project-context aware analysis
- Individual component focus → system-wide consistency check
- Standard practices → project-specific best practices
```

#### Architecture Decision Workflow
```
User: "How should I implement the new filter feature?"

Claude Code Process:
1. Calls: /project:architect new filter feature implementation
2. Gemini analyzes existing filtering patterns and architecture
3. Gemini provides approach that integrates with current systems
4. Claude Code implements following established patterns

Result:
- Isolated decisions → architecture-aware design
- Potential inconsistencies → pattern-following implementation
- Reinventing patterns → reusing proven approaches
```

## Phase 4: Advanced Features (Optional - 60 minutes)

### 4.1 Persistent Context Management

#### Update Command
**File**: `.claude/commands/gemini-update.md`
```markdown
---
description: Update Gemini's project context after significant changes
allowed-tools: [bash]
---

# Context Update

! gemini -p "UPDATE: The BS Display project has been modified: $ARGUMENTS

Please update your understanding of:
1. Any architectural changes
2. New patterns or components
3. Modified data structures
4. Updated development standards
5. New dependencies or integrations

Maintain comprehensive project knowledge for future queries."
```

### 4.2 Specialized Query Types

#### Pattern Analysis
```bash
/project:gemini find all components using ProductFilter pattern and show implementation differences
```

#### Data Flow Tracing
```bash
/project:gemini trace complete data flow from user quiz input to final product recommendations
```

#### Performance Analysis
```bash
/project:gemini identify all image loading implementations and potential performance bottlenecks
```

#### Dependency Analysis
```bash
/project:gemini show all components that would be affected by changing the models.*.json schema
```
