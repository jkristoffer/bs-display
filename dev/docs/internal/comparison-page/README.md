## Quick Reference

### Key Features Implemented
1. **Side-by-side specs table** - Technical specifications with highlighted differences
2. **Feature matrix** - Checkmark grid showing what each panel includes/lacks
3. **Use case recommendations** - "Better for classrooms vs boardrooms"
4. **Pros/cons lists** - Clear advantages/disadvantages for each panel
5. **Winner badges** - Best in category (performance, value, features)
6. **Size visualizer** - Overlay panels on room backgrounds
7. **Sticky comparison bar** - Key differences always visible while scrolling
8. **Print/share comparison** - Export findings as PDF

## Development Guidelines

### Prerequisites
Before implementing components:
1. Review existing product data structure in `/src/data/models.*.json`
2. Understand functional programming patterns used in the project
3. Review component standards in [Component Standards](../../development/standards/standards/component-standards.md)
4. Familiarize yourself with the enhanced design system

### Implementation Order
1. **Phase 1**: Core structure and specs table
2. **Phase 2**: Feature components (matrix, recommendations, pros/cons, badges)
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced features (visualizer, sticky bar, export)
4. **Phase 4**: Polish, testing, and optimization

### Quality Gates
- Follow functional programming principles
- Run code review agent: `npm run code:review -- --file [file]`
- Ensure TypeScript validation: `npm run code:typecheck`
- Test build process: `npm run dev:build`
- Maintain WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Requirements
- Page load time < 3 seconds
- Interactive elements respond < 100ms
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Progressive loading for large datasets

### Data Integration
- Leverage existing product data from `models.*.json` files
- Extend current data structure with comparison-specific fields
- Implement validation and quality assurance for data consistency
- Create configuration files for scoring and use case definitions

### Styling and Design
- Use established SCSS architecture with component modules
- Integrate with enhanced gradient system and component library
- Follow responsive design patterns and mobile-first approach
- Maintain brand consistency and design system standards

## Dependencies and Tools

### External Libraries
- PDF generation library for export functionality
- Image optimization for room background visualizations
- Chart/visualization library for scoring displays

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing product data structure and models
- Component library (Card, Button, Form components)
- Enhanced design system and gradient utilities
- Analytics integration for tracking user engagement

## Success Metrics

### User Engagement
- Time spent on comparison pages
- Interaction with comparison tools
- Export/share functionality usage
- Conversion rate to product detail pages

### Technical Performance
- Page load speed and performance scores
- Mobile vs desktop usage patterns
- Error rates and user feedback
- Search engine optimization effectiveness

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- Multi-product comparison (3+ products)
- Save/bookmark comparisons
- Comparison history and user accounts
- Advanced filtering and sorting options
- AI-powered recommendation engine
- Video comparison demonstrations

### Scalability Considerations
- Database integration for large product catalogs
- API endpoints for real-time pricing
- Content management system integration
- Multi-language support
- Advanced analytics and user behavior tracking

## Support and Maintenance
