- **69% reduction plan** finalized (327 â†’ 100 variables) exceeding 67% target
- **13 duplicate groups** identified for consolidation
- **Evidence-based decisions** documented with comprehensive rationale

### Key Insights from Day 6 Analysis

**High-Impact Variables Identified**:
- `--color-accent-primary`: 191 occurrences (41 files) - Primary brand color critical
- `--spacing-md`: 187 occurrences (24 files) - Most used spacing variable
- `--spacing-lg`: 133 occurrences (19 files) - Large spacing critical
- `--spacing-sm`: 131 occurrences (22 files) - Small spacing frequently used
- `--color-text-primary`: 130 occurrences (34 files) - Text color crucial

**System Health Assessment**:
- **Color System**: Good consistency, ready for consolidation
- **Spacing System**: Needs 8px grid improvement (29% â†’ 100% compliance)
- **Typography**: Competing systems ready for unification (72 â†’ 15 variables)
- **Button System**: Major consolidation opportunity (16 â†’ 6 variables)

## Day 7 Preparation Complete

### âœ… Comprehensive Day 7 Plan Created

**Based on Real Day 6 Data**:
- **Semantic token structure** designed using actual usage patterns
- **Migration scripts** built with precise variable mapping (327 variables)
- **Backward compatibility** planned for high-usage variables (191+ occurrences)
- **Validation framework** established with isolated testing approach

### Day 7 Tasks Ready for Execution

1. **Morning Session (4 hours)**:
   - **Task 7.1**: Create 100-variable semantic token system (120 min)
   - **Task 7.2**: Build migration scripts with comprehensive mapping (90 min)
   - **Task 7.3**: Implement backward compatibility layer (30 min)

2. **Afternoon Session (4 hours)**:
   - **Task 7.4**: Integrate new token system (120 min)
   - **Task 7.5**: Test tokens in isolation (60 min)
