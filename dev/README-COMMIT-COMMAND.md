# ðŸš€ Claude Code Fast Commit Commands

Multiple ways to use intelligent fast git commits with Claude Code!

## **Method 1: Self-Contained Slash Command (Recommended)**

### Usage:
```bash
/project:commit
```

### Setup:
âœ… **Already configured** in this project at `.claude/commands/commit.md`

- **Self-contained**: All logic embedded in the slash command
- **No dependencies**: Works even if script files are deleted  
- **2-5 seconds**: Same speed as before
- **Fully portable**: Complete independence from external files

---

## **Method 2: Universal Slash Command**

### Usage:
```bash
/user:fastcommit
```

### Setup:
âœ… **Already configured** globally at `~/.claude/commands/fastcommit.md`

- Works in **any git repository**
- Uses Claude AI to analyze changes and generate commits
- Takes 10-20 seconds but works everywhere

---

## **Method 3: Direct Script Execution**

### Usage:
```bash
./scripts/commit
```

### Features:
- **Fastest**: 2-5 seconds
- **Local script**: No Claude AI needed
- **Intelligent**: Conventional commit format
- **Filtering**: Excludes logs, temp files

---

## **Method 4: Global Command**

### Setup:
```bash
./install-global-commit.sh
```

### Usage from anywhere:
```bash
commit
```

## **ðŸŽ¯ Comparison:**

| Method | Speed | Scope | Intelligence | Dependencies | Setup |
|--------|-------|-------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| `/project:commit` | 2-5s | This project | High | **None** | âœ… Done |
| `/user:fastcommit` | 10-20s | Any project | Very High | Claude AI | âœ… Done |
| `./scripts/commit` | 2-5s | This project | High | Script file | âœ… Done |
| `commit` (global) | 2-5s | Any project | High | Script file | Run installer |

## **ðŸ’¡ Recommended Usage:**

- **In this project**: Use `/project:commit` for maximum speed and reliability
- **Other projects**: Use `/user:fastcommit` for universal AI-powered commits
- **Command line**: Use `./scripts/commit` for direct execution

## **âœ¨ Key Advantage of Method 1:**
**Self-contained design** means the slash command is **bulletproof** - it will work even if:
- Script files get deleted
- Directory structure changes  
- External dependencies break
- You move the `.claude/commands/commit.md` to other projects

All methods are **10-30x faster** than the old GitHub Actions approach (45-90s)! ðŸš€
