## Execution Guidelines

quick_start:
  immediate_actions:
    - "Start with Phase 1 backup immediately"
    - "Create refactor/navigation-simplification branch"
    - "Focus on fixing hydration error in Phase 2"
  
  critical_path:
    - "Phase 2 is most critical - fixes the breaking issue"
    - "Phases 3-4 restore full functionality"
    - "Phase 5-6 ensure quality and deployment"

key_principles:
  - "NO forwardRef usage anywhere"
  - "Keep components simple and flat"
  - "State in single location"
  - "CSS for animations, not JS"
  - "Maintain exact same functionality"

testing_strategy:
  continuous:
    - "Test after each phase"
    - "Run build frequently"
    - "Check browser console"
  
  final:
    - "Full regression testing"
    - "Cross-browser testing"
    - "Performance validation"

## Risk Mitigation

potential_blockers:
  - issue: "Search component uses forwardRef"
    mitigation: "Refactor Search in Phase 3"
  
  - issue: "SCSS dependencies break"
    mitigation: "Keep same class names"
  
  - issue: "Mobile scroll lock issues"
    mitigation: "Test on real devices early"

rollback_plan:
  - "Keep Nav.backup available"
  - "Branch protection on main"
  - "Feature flag if needed"
  - "Quick revert capability"

## Success Metrics

must_achieve:
