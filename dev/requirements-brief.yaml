# Navigation Component Refactoring Requirements Brief

project: Navigation Component Refactoring
priority: URGENT
reason: Current implementation causing hydration errors preventing navigation from rendering

## Goals
primary_objective: Remove all unnecessary complexity while maintaining exact current functionality
specific_goals:
  - Eliminate all forwardRef usage causing React hydration errors
  - Reduce component hierarchy depth
  - Simplify state management
  - Remove unused code and types
  - Maintain all current user-facing features

## Current State Analysis
problems_identified:
  - forwardRef_overuse: All nav components use forwardRef unnecessarily
  - state_complexity: 9+ pieces of state across multiple components
  - props_drilling: Props passed through 4+ levels of components
  - type_overengineering: 346 lines of types, many unused
  - imperative_apis: Extensive useImperativeHandle exposing unused methods
  - event_handling: Complex mixed touch/mouse/keyboard handlers
  - unused_code: NavWrapper.tsx and numerous type definitions

## Functional Requirements
must_preserve:
  desktop_features:
    - Sticky navigation header
    - Logo and main navigation links
    - Products dropdown with mega menu
    - Resources dropdown menu
    - Search functionality
    - Active state indicators
    - CTA button styling
  
  mobile_features:
    - Hamburger menu toggle
    - Full-screen mobile menu
    - Grid-based navigation sections
    - Touch-optimized interactions
    - Mobile search toggle
    - Body scroll locking when menu open
  
  interactions:
    - Keyboard navigation support
    - Click outside to close dropdowns
    - Escape key to close menus
    - Smooth animations
    - Responsive behavior at 1024px breakpoint

## Technical Requirements
must_remove:
  - All React.forwardRef usage
  - All useImperativeHandle implementations
  - Unused components (NavWrapper.tsx)
  - Unused type definitions
  - Complex ref management patterns

must_simplify:
  - Component hierarchy (flatten from 5+ levels to 2-3)
  - State management (consolidate into single source)
  - Event handling (unified approach)
  - Type definitions (only what's needed)
  - Props passing (use composition or context)

must_maintain:
  - TypeScript type safety
  - Astro integration compatibility
  - Current SCSS module styling
  - Accessibility features
  - SEO-friendly markup

## Constraints
technical_constraints:
  - Must work with Astro's client:only hydration
  - Must use React 18.3.1 (current version)
  - Cannot change public-facing HTML structure
  - Must maintain current CSS class names for styling
  
time_constraints:
  - Urgent implementation required
  - Single refactor, not incremental
  - Must fix hydration error immediately

## Success Criteria
functional_success:
  - Navigation renders without hydration errors
  - All current features work identically
  - No visual or behavioral changes
  - Maintains responsive behavior

technical_success:
  - Zero forwardRef usage
  - Reduced to max 3 component levels
  - Single state management approach
  - 50%+ reduction in code complexity
  - Clean, maintainable code structure

## Implementation Approach
recommended_strategy:
  1. Create single Nav component with internal sub-components
  2. Use composition over complex hierarchies  
  3. Replace imperative APIs with declarative patterns
  4. Consolidate state into top-level component
  5. Use CSS for animations instead of JS where possible
  6. Remove all ref forwarding and imperative handles

## Testing Requirements
validation_approach:
  - Manual testing of all navigation features
  - Desktop and mobile responsive testing
  - Keyboard navigation verification
  - Production build testing
  - Hydration error verification

## Risk Mitigation
potential_risks:
  - Breaking existing functionality
  - CSS styling dependencies
  - Hidden feature dependencies

mitigation_strategy:
  - Keep original components as backup
  - Test thoroughly before replacing
  - Document any behavioral differences
  - Maintain same HTML structure
