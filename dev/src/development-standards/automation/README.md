# Automated Blog Generation System

This document describes the automated blog post generation system that creates new blog content every 3 days using GitHub Actions and template-based content generation.

## Overview

The automated blog generation system consists of four main components:

1. **Content Queue System** - Manages upcoming blog topics and metadata
2. **Content Generation Script** - Creates blog posts using templates and data
3. **GitHub Actions Workflow** - Automates the generation and review process
4. **Review and Publication Process** - Human oversight before publishing

## System Architecture

```
GitHub Actions (every 3 days)
├── Read next topic from content-queue.json
├── Generate blog post using templates
├── Create feature branch with generated content
├── Open Pull Request for human review
└── Auto-merge after approval OR create issue if failed
```

## Components

### 1. Content Queue System

**File:** `content-queue.json`

The content queue is a JSON database containing:

- **Scheduled Posts**: Array of blog post topics with full metadata
- **Templates**: Reusable content structure definitions  
- **Content Guidelines**: Brand voice, SEO requirements, quality standards
- **Automation Settings**: Scheduling and workflow configuration

**Queue Structure:**
```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "scheduledPosts": [
    {
      "id": "001",
      "title": "Blog Post Title",
      "description": "SEO meta description",
      "category": "Content Category",
      "template": "comparison|how-to|use-case|buyer-guide",
      "priority": "high|medium|low",
      "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
      "targetAudience": "business_decision_makers",
      "estimatedReadTime": "8 minutes",
      "data": {
        "mainTopic": "Topic Name",
        "hook": "Engaging opening line",
        "cta": "Custom call-to-action"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Content Generation Script

**File:** `scripts/generate-blog-post.js`

Node.js ES module that:

- **Reads** next post from content queue
- **Generates** full blog post content using templates
- **Creates** markdown file with proper frontmatter
- **Updates** queue by removing processed post
- **Handles** errors and edge cases

**Key Features:**
- Template-based content generation for consistency
- SEO-optimized frontmatter generation
- Automatic slug generation from titles
- Queue management and rotation
- Comprehensive error handling

**Templates Available:**
- **Comparison**: Technology/product comparisons
- **How-To**: Step-by-step instructional guides  
- **Use-Case**: Industry-specific application examples
- **Buyer-Guide**: Product selection and purchasing advice

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/automated-blog-generation.yml`

Automated workflow that:

- **Triggers** every 3 days at 9:00 AM UTC
- **Checks** content queue for available posts
- **Generates** blog post using the script
- **Creates** feature branch and Pull Request
- **Adds** detailed comments and metadata
- **Handles** failures by creating issues

**Workflow Steps:**
1. Checkout repository and setup Node.js
2. Install dependencies and check queue status
3. Generate blog post if content available
4. Create feature branch with generated content
5. Open Pull Request with review checklist
6. Add generation report and quality notes
7. Handle failures with automated issue creation

### 4. Review and Publication Process

**Human Review Requirements:**

Before merging generated content, reviewers must verify:

- [ ] **Content Quality**: Technical accuracy and messaging
- [ ] **SEO Elements**: Title, description, and keyword usage
- [ ] **Brand Voice**: Consistency with brand standards
- [ ] **Links and CTAs**: All links and calls-to-action work
- [ ] **Formatting**: Markdown structure and readability
- [ ] **Images**: Add relevant images (not auto-generated)

**Approval Workflow:**
1. Automated PR created with generated content
2. Human reviewer examines content quality
3. Edits made directly in PR if needed
4. PR approved and merged to publish
5. Next generation scheduled automatically

## Usage

### Manual Generation

Generate a blog post manually:

```bash
cd scripts
node generate-blog-post.js
```

### Manual Workflow Trigger

Trigger GitHub Action manually:

1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Automated Blog Post Generation"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Optionally force generation even if queue is empty

### Queue Management

**Adding New Topics:**

Edit `content-queue.json` to add new posts to the `scheduledPosts` array:

```json
{
  "id": "009",
  "title": "New Blog Post Title",
  "description": "SEO description 150-160 characters",
  "category": "Category Name",
  "template": "comparison",
  "priority": "high",
  "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
  "targetAudience": "target_audience",
  "estimatedReadTime": "X minutes",
  "data": {
    "mainTopic": "Main Topic",
    "techA": "First Technology (for comparisons)",
    "techB": "Second Technology (for comparisons)",
    "industry": "Industry Name (for use-cases)",
    "market": "Market Name (for buyer-guides)",
    "hook": "Engaging opening line",
    "cta": "Custom call-to-action"
  }
}
```

**Queue Priority:**
- **High**: Will be selected first for generation
- **Medium**: Standard priority
- **Low**: Generated after higher priority posts
