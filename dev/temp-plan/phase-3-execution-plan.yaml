phase_name: "Panel Selection Component"
phase_number: 3
overview: "Build the interactive panel selection interface that allows users to choose up to 2 panels from the product catalog, integrating with existing filtering system and implementing proper selection state management."

prerequisites:
  - Completed Phase 2 data layer utilities
  - Identified reusable filtering components from Phase 1
  - Understanding of existing React component patterns
  - Access to product catalog data and filtering logic

technical_specifications:
  - "Use React functional components with hooks for state management"
  - "Implement proper TypeScript interfaces for all props and state"
  - "Follow existing component patterns from /src/components/"
  - "Use SCSS modules for component-scoped styling"
  - "Integrate with existing filtering logic without breaking current functionality"
  - "Implement proper event handling for panel selection"
  - "Use existing design system utilities and patterns"

quality_gates:
  - "Component renders correctly with product catalog data"
  - "Filtering system integration doesn't break existing functionality"
  - "Selection state management properly tracks up to 2 panels"
  - "Validation prevents selection of more than 2 panels"
  - "Visual feedback clearly indicates selected panels"
  - "Component follows existing design system patterns"
  - "TypeScript compilation passes without errors"

risk_mitigation:
  - "State management complexity: Use simple useState hooks with clear separation of concerns"
  - "Performance with large catalogs: Implement virtualization if needed for large product lists"
  - "Integration conflicts: Test thoroughly with existing filtering components"
  - "UI/UX confusion: Provide clear visual feedback and selection limits"
  - "Mobile responsiveness: Test on various screen sizes during development"

resources_needed:
  - "React development environment"
