## üö® CRITICAL FIRST - AI Development Rules

**These rules must be followed for every task:**

1. **Always verify context first** - Use Glob/LS tools before coding to confirm files exist
2. **Follow functional programming** - Pure functions, immutability, composition ([Standards](./docs/development/standards/development-standards/functional-programming.md))
3. **Run code review agent** - After generating code: `npm run code:review -- --file [file]`
4. **Use TodoWrite tool** - For complex tasks requiring planning and tracking

---

## ‚ö° UNIFIED TOOL INTERFACE

**All project tools accessible through consistent npm commands.**

### **Quick Access**
```bash
npm run help                    # See all available commands
npm run ai:do <intent> [params] # Primary entry point for AI-driven tasks
```

This project utilizes a unified `npm run` command interface. For a comprehensive, machine-readable list of all available intents and their parameters, use `npm run ai:do list-intents`.

---

## ü§ñ AI-FIRST ARCHITECTURE & TOOLING

This project is built on AI-First principles, providing structured, machine-readable interfaces for enhanced AI collaboration and autonomy. Key components include `ai-config.json` (centralized AI configuration), `ai-intents.json` (high-level intent mapping), `component-manifest.json` (programmatic UI inventory), and `.ai-events.log` (structured action logging). All AI-First documentation adheres to `ai-doc-schema.json` for consistent machine-readability.

For detailed, machine-readable specifications of these components and their associated scripts (`scripts/ai-do.js`, `scripts/validate-project.js`, `scripts/generate-component-manifest.js`, `scripts/ai-log.js`), refer to the JSON documentation files located in [./docs/internal/ai-docs/](./docs/internal/ai-docs/).

## üß† RAG PROJECT MEMORY

**Transform from stateless AI to project-aware assistant with comprehensive codebase memory.**

‚ö†Ô∏è **The RAG system has been moved to a separate repository for better modularity.** Refer to the [bs-rag-tools repository](https://github.com/kristoffersanio/bs-rag-tools) for setup and usage.

---

## üìÑ PDF ANALYSIS (MCP SERVER)

**Analyze PDF files using Gemini CLI through Claude Code integration.**

‚ö†Ô∏è **The MCP PDF analyzer has been moved to a separate repository for better modularity.** Refer to the [bs-mcp-servers repository](https://github.com/kristoffersanio/bs-mcp-servers) for setup and usage.

---

## üÜò EMERGENCY QUICK ACCESS

For immediate troubleshooting and system health checks, utilize the AI-First validation and intent discovery tools.

*   **General Project Validation**: `npm run ai:do validate-project` (provides structured JSON output for analysis).
*   **Discover Troubleshooting Commands**: `npm run ai:do list-intents` (to find specific intents for various issues).

For detailed emergency procedures, refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/quick-start/troubleshooting.md).

## ü§ù HUMAN-AI COLLABORATION MODEL

### **Human Responsibilities**
- **Strategic Decisions**: Architecture choices, business logic, user experience
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Define what "done" looks like
- **Final Verification**: Review implementation against requirements
- **Code Review**: Approve changes affecting core functionality

### **AI Responsibilities**
- **Implementation**: Write code, create components, implement features  
- **Documentation**: Generate inline docs, update relevant files
- **Debugging**: Identify and fix implementation issues
- **Quality Assurance**: Run code review agent, ensure standards compliance

### **Development Velocity Targets**
- **Simple tasks**: 30-60 minutes (single component changes)
- **Medium tasks**: 2-4 hours (multiple components, some integration)
- **Complex tasks**: 4+ hours (architectural changes, multiple sessions)

### **Task Communication Patterns**

#### **Effective Task Requests**
```markdown
// ‚úÖ Good: Specific and actionable
"Add hover zoom to ProductImage component with 2x magnification that follows cursor position"

// ‚ùå Poor: Vague and unclear  
"Make images better"

// ‚úÖ Good: Clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] Image zooms to 2x scale on hover
- [ ] Zoom follows mouse cursor position  
- [ ] Zoom resets when mouse leaves image area
- [ ] Works on desktop and mobile devices
```

#### **Complexity Indicators**
- **Simple**: Single component change, clear requirements, 30min-2hrs
- **Medium**: Multiple related changes, some integration, 2-6hrs
- **Complex**: Cross-cutting changes, architectural decisions, 6+ hrs or multiple sessions

---

## üîÑ DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

### **For Simple Tasks (30min-2hrs)**
1. **Understand**: Clarify requirements and acceptance criteria
2. **Verify**: Check imports, dependencies, existing patterns using Glob/LS tools
3. **Implement**: Write code following functional programming standards
4. **Validate**: Test functionality and run code review agent

### **For Complex Tasks (Multi-session/6+ hrs)**
1. **Plan**: Break into logical phases, use TodoWrite for tracking progress
2. **Implement Incrementally**: Complete phases one at a time
3. **Verify Each Phase**: Ensure stability before moving forward
4. **Document**: Summarize progress and architectural decisions made

### **Quality Gates**
```bash
# After implementing any code changes (enhanced security & performance analysis)
npm run code:review -- --file [modified-file]

# Security-focused review for sensitive components
npm run code:review -- --file [auth-component] --ai-mode --format json

# Before considering task complete
npm run code:typecheck  # TypeScript validation
npm run dev:build       # Ensure build succeeds

# Batch quality check for entire feature
npm run code:review -- --batch src/components/[feature]/ --threshold-failing 75
```

### **Error Recovery Patterns**

#### **TypeScript Errors**
1. Run `npm run code:typecheck` to see specific errors
2. Check [Component Standards](./docs/development/standards/standards/component-standards.md) for patterns
3. Verify imports match file naming conventions

#### **Build Failures**
1. Check console output for specific errors
2. Run `npm run dev:build:fast` to skip image optimization
3. Verify all imports use correct paths and extensions

#### **Context Confusion**
1. Use Glob tool to find files: `*.tsx`, `**/*.astro`
2. Use LS tool to explore directory structure
3. Reference [Troubleshooting Guide](./docs/quick-start/troubleshooting.md)
