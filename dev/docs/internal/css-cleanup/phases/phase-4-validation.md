## CSS Best Practices

### Variable Usage
Always use semantic tokens from the design system:
```scss
// ✅ Correct - Use semantic tokens
.component {
  color: $color-text-primary;
  padding: $spacing-md;
  border-radius: $radius-lg;
}

// ❌ Incorrect - No hardcoded values
.component {
  color: #333333;
  padding: 16px;
  border-radius: 8px;
}
```

### Component Structure
Always use CSS modules for component styling:
```tsx
// ComponentName.tsx
import styles from './ComponentName.module.scss';

export function ComponentName() {
  return <div className={styles.container}>Content</div>;
}
```

```scss
// ComponentName.module.scss
@import '../../styles/variables';

.container {
  background-color: $color-background-light;
  padding: $spacing-lg;
}
```

### Common Patterns
- Use semantic class names that describe purpose, not appearance
- Import variables at the top of each module file
- Group related styles logically within modules
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts, not floats or positioning
```
