      question: 'Do smartboards work with gloves?',
      answer:
        "It depends on the touch technology. Infrared (IR) and optical systems work with gloves, while capacitive screens typically don't unless they're specially designed for capacitive touch."
    },
    {
      question: 'Which technology is best for artists?',
      answer:
        'Electromagnetic Resonance (EMR) technology paired with OLED displays offers the highest precision and pressure sensitivity, making it ideal for artists and designers who need detailed control.'
    },
    {
      question: "What's the lifespan of a smartboard?",
      answer:
        'Most quality smart whiteboards have a lifespan of 5-7 years with regular use. OLED displays may have shorter lifespans (3-5 years) while LED displays can last 7-10 years with proper care.'
    },
    {
      question: 'Is a special pen always required?',
      answer:
        'No. IR, optical, and resistive technologies work with any object. EMR requires a special pen, while capacitive screens work with fingers and compatible styluses.'
