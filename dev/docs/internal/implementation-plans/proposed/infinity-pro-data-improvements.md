# Proposed Improvements for Infinity Pro Product Data

This document outlines recommendations for enhancing the existing Infinity Pro product data, based on recent online research and comparison with current data.

## Current Data Status

Our `models.infinitypro.json` file contains product data for various Infinity Pro X Series models (55", 65", 75", 86", 98"). The data includes core specifications like resolution, brightness, contrast ratio, viewing angle, lifespan, OS, touch technology, and features.

## Discrepancies and Additional Information Found Online

During the online search, the following points were noted:

*   **Screen Sizes:** An additional **110"** screen size was mentioned for Infinity Pro panels.
*   **Lifespan:** While our data states "50,000 hours", online sources indicate a range of **50,000 to 100,000 hours**.
*   **Processor:** Our current data lacks processor details. Online sources mention "Quad-core ARM Cortex-A55" or "8 Core A55 processor".
*   **Memory and Storage:** Our data does not include RAM and internal storage. Online sources specify options for **4GB to 8GB of RAM** and **32GB to 128GB of internal storage**.
*   **Warranty:** Our data states a "5 years" warranty, while online sources commonly mention a "3-year warranty" with options for extension.
*   **Ports:** More specific details on ports, such as "USB Type-C", were found.
*   **Software Features:** "Built-in Document Viewer" and "Annotation Tools" are highlighted as key features online but are not explicitly listed in our current data.

## Recommendations for Improvement

To make our Infinity Pro product data more comprehensive, accurate, and aligned with publicly available information, the following improvements are recommended:

1.  **Include 110" Model:** If confirmed as a standard offering, add data for the 110" screen size model.
2.  **Refine Lifespan Data:** Update the `panelLife` field to reflect the potential range (e.g., "50,000 - 100,000 hours") or clarify if 50,000 hours is a minimum.
3.  **Add Processor Information:** Introduce a new field, e.g., `"processor"`, to capture details like "Quad-core ARM Cortex-A55" or "8 Core A55".
4.  **Incorporate Memory and Storage:** Add fields for `"ram"` (e.g., "8GB") and `"internalStorage"` (e.g., "128GB") to provide crucial performance specifications.
5.  **Verify Warranty Period:** Reconfirm the standard warranty period. If it's 3 years with extensions, update the `warranty` field accordingly and consider adding a field for extension options if relevant.
6.  **Detail Port Specifications:** Expand the `features` array or add a new field, e.g., `"ports"`, to list specific port types like "USB Type-C" where applicable.
7.  **Add Software Features:** Explicitly include "Built-in Document Viewer" and "Annotation Tools" within the `features` array, as these are significant selling points.
8.  **Review Touch Technology Consistency:** Double-check the "Optical Bonded" touch technology for the 55" model against other sources to ensure its accuracy, as most others are Infrared or Capacitive.
9.  **Standardize "N/A" Usage:** Ensure that fields are either populated with accurate data or omitted if truly not applicable, rather than using "N/A" where specific values could be found.

Implementing these recommendations will enhance the richness and accuracy of our Infinity Pro product data, providing a more complete picture for internal use and external presentation.
